# This file serves as a control mechanism for version increments in the CI/CD pipeline.
#
# Each module is listed with an increment type to specify how its version should be updated,
# if any changes are detected in its codebase during the pipeline execution.
#
# Enum values for increments:
# - major: Increases the major version (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
# - minor: Increases the minor version (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
# - patch: Increases the patch version (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
#
# If no codebase changes are detected for a specific module, CI/CD will skip incrementing its version.
